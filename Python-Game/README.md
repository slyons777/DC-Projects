 <p> This is a text-based BlackJack game set up using Python3. Kept it pretty simple as far as the game rules go, basic instructions only, which you can view by selecting on the game option (2) on the game menu. 
 
 The goal here was to create a small game implementing Object Oriented Programming by way of classes and methods. Stay tuned for updates as I learn more about Python3. :blue_book::memo: <p>
        

        
#####Python tools used:
        
            1. Colorama/Fore (for terminal colors) 
            2. random function import for dealer shuffles
            3. For and While loops
            4. Classes and methods
